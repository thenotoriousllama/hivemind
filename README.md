  Persistent, cloud-backed shared memory for <b>Claude Code • OpenClaw • Codex • Cursor • Hermes • pi</b> agents.<br>
</p>

> One session ends, everything important disappears. 
>
> Hivemind finally fixes the "agent amnesia" problem. 

Hivemind automatically captures every prompt, tool call, decision, and file operation. Then turns them into searchable memory that is instantly available to every agent and teammate across sessions, machines, and time.

- 🧠 **Captures** every session's prompts, tool calls, and responses into a shared SQL table on Deeplake Cloud
- 🔍 **Searches** across all memory with lexical search (falls back to grep when index unavailable)
- 🔗 **Shares** memory across sessions, agents, teammates, and machines in real-time
- 📁 **Intercepts** file operations on `~/.deeplake/memory/` through a virtual filesystem backed by SQL
- 📝 **Summarizes** sessions into AI-generated wiki pages via a background worker at session end

## Quick start

One command, all your agents:

```bash
npm install -g @deeplake/hivemind && hivemind install
```

That's it. The installer detects every supported assistant on your machine (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Cursor, Hermes Agent, pi), wires up the hooks, and opens a browser once for login. Restart your assistants and they all share the same brain.

**Install for a specific assistant only:**

```bash
hivemind install --only claude
hivemind claude install    # equivalent
hivemind codex install
hivemind claw install
hivemind cursor install
hivemind hermes install
hivemind pi install
```

**Check what's wired up:**

```bash
hivemind status
```

**Supported assistants:**

### Alternative install paths

<details>
  <summary><b>Claude Code plugin marketplace</b></summary>

If you prefer Claude Code's native plugin marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add activeloopai/hivemind
/plugin install hivemind
/reload-plugins
/hivemind:login
```

Auto-updates on each session start. Manual update: `/hivemind:update`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>OpenClaw ClawHub</b></summary>

```
openclaw plugins install clawhub:hivemind
```

Then type `/hivemind_login` in chat, click the auth link, and sign in.

#### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/hivemind_login` | Sign in via device flow |
| `/hivemind_capture` | Toggle capture on/off |
| `/hivemind_whoami` | Show current org and workspace |
| `/hivemind_orgs` | List organizations |
| `/hivemind_switch_org <name>` | Switch organization |
| `/hivemind_workspaces` | List workspaces |
| `/hivemind_switch_workspace <id>` | Switch workspace |
| `/hivemind_update` | Check for plugin updates |

Auto-recall and auto-capture are enabled by default. Data is stored in the same `sessions` table as Claude Code and Codex.

#### Coexistence with `memory-core`

Hivemind runs **alongside** OpenClaw's built-in `memory-core` plugin. It does **not** claim the memory slot, so `memory-core`'s dreaming cron (`"0 3 * * *"`) and other memory-slot-dependent jobs keep working. Hivemind captures session activity and exposes its own commands; `memory-core` keeps owning recall/promotion/dreaming.

#### Troubleshooting

- **Hivemind seems slow or unresponsive.** Check the agent model in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `agents.defaults.model`. Hivemind makes many small tool calls per turn; a large reasoning model like Opus will feel sluggish. Recommended default: `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.
- **`openclaw model <id>` says "plugins.allow excludes model".** The `model` plugin CLI is disabled by default. Edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` directly (key `agents.defaults.model`) and restart the gateway: `systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway.service`.
- **Model switch rejected as "not allowed".** Use the exact dated provider-prefixed ID (`anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`). Legacy IDs like `claude-3-5-haiku-latest` and unprefixed bare IDs are not on OpenClaw's allowlist.
- **Self-update via Telegram fails with "elevated is not available".** `tools.elevated.allowFrom` must include `telegram` before elevated commands work from that channel. Safer alternative: run the upgrade in a local shell with `openclaw plugins update hivemind`.
- **`npm error EACCES` during self-update.** OpenClaw was installed under a root-owned npm prefix (e.g. `/usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw`). Reinstall under a user-writable prefix, or run the update with appropriate privileges locally — not via a channel.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Codex (manual)</b></summary>

Tell Codex to fetch and follow the install instructions:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/activeloopai/hivemind/main/codex/INSTALL.md
```

Or run the installer script directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/activeloopai/hivemind.git ~/.codex/hivemind
~/.codex/hivemind/codex/install.sh
```

Restart Codex to activate.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Cursor (1.7+)</b></summary>

The unified installer wires six lifecycle events in `~/.cursor/hooks.json` — sessionStart, beforeSubmitPrompt, postToolUse, afterAgentResponse, stop, sessionEnd. Hooks fork a Node bundle at `~/.cursor/hivemind/bundle/` per event. Restart Cursor after install to load.

```bash
hivemind cursor install
```

Auto-capture is enabled the same way as Claude Code / Codex / OpenClaw.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Hermes Agent</b></summary>

Wires shell hooks into `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (`pre_llm_call` / `post_tool_call` / `post_llm_call` / `on_session_end`) for auto-capture, drops the bundle at `~/.hermes/hivemind/bundle/`, registers the shared MCP server (`~/.hivemind/mcp/server.js`) under `mcp_servers.hivemind`, and installs an `agentskills.io`-compatible skill at `~/.hermes/skills/hivemind-memory/` for recall.

```bash
hivemind hermes install
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>pi (badlogic/pi-mono coding-agent)</b></summary>

Upserts an idempotent BEGIN/END marker block into `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` (auto-loaded every turn) and drops a TypeScript extension at `~/.pi/agent/extensions/hivemind.ts`. The extension subscribes to pi's lifecycle events (`session_start` / `input` / `tool_result` / `message_end`) for auto-capture and registers `hivemind_search`, `hivemind_read`, `hivemind_index` as first-class pi tools.

```bash
hivemind pi install
```

Note: no per-agent SKILL.md is dropped under `~/.pi/agent/skills/` — pi reads skills from both that directory AND the shared `~/.agents/skills/` location. If the codex installer has run on the same machine, pi picks up the hivemind skill from the shared `~/.agents/skills/hivemind-memory` symlink automatically. The AGENTS.md block plus the registered tools cover the action surface in either case.

```

Every session is captured. Every agent can recall. Teammates in the same org see the same memory.

## Features

### 🔍 Natural search

Just ask Claude naturally:

```
"What was Emanuele working on?"
"Search memory for authentication bugs"
"What did we decide about the API design?"
```

### 📝 AI-generated session summaries

After each session, a background worker generates a wiki summary: key decisions, code changes, next steps. Browse them at `~/.deeplake/memory/summaries/`.

### 👥 Team sharing

Invite teammates to your Deeplake org. Their agents see your memory, your agents see theirs. No setup, no sync, no merge conflicts.

### 🔒 Privacy controls

Disable capture entirely:

```bash
HIVEMIND_CAPTURE=false claude
```

Enable debug logging:

```bash
HIVEMIND_DEBUG=1 claude
```

## ⚠️ Data collection notice

This plugin captures session activity and stores it in your Deeplake workspace:

| Data                  | What's captured                    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| User prompts          | Every message you send             |
| Tool calls            | Tool name + full input             |
| Tool responses        | Full tool output                   |
| Assistant responses   | Claude's final response            |
| Subagent activity     | Subagent tool calls and responses  |

**All users in your Deeplake workspace can read this data.** A DATA NOTICE is displayed at the start of every session.

## Configuration

| Variable                  | Default                   | Description                                |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `HIVEMIND_TOKEN`          | —                         | API token (auto-set by login)              |
| `HIVEMIND_ORG_ID`         | —                         | Organization ID (auto-set by login)        |
| `HIVEMIND_WORKSPACE_ID`   | `default`                 | Workspace name                             |
| `HIVEMIND_API_URL`        | `https://api.deeplake.ai` | API endpoint                               |
| `HIVEMIND_TABLE`          | `memory`                  | SQL table for summaries and virtual FS     |
| `HIVEMIND_SESSIONS_TABLE` | `sessions`                | SQL table for per-event session capture    |
| `HIVEMIND_MEMORY_PATH`    | `~/.deeplake/memory`      | Path that triggers interception            |
| `HIVEMIND_CAPTURE`        | `true`                    | Set to `false` to disable capture          |
| `HIVEMIND_EMBEDDINGS`     | `true`                    | Set to `false` to force lexical-only mode  |
| `HIVEMIND_DEBUG`          | —                         | Set to `1` for verbose hook debug logs     |

## Optional: enable semantic search (embeddings)

Hivemind can run a local embedding daemon (nomic-embed-text-v1.5, ~130 MB)
so that `Grep` over `~/.deeplake/memory/` uses hybrid semantic + lexical
ranking instead of pure BM25. This is **off by default** — the daemon
depends on `@huggingface/transformers`, which pulls onnxruntime-node and
sharp (~600 MB total with native binaries). Shipping that with every agent
install would 60× the install size for a feature most users don't need.

To enable, run the bundled command:

```bash
hivemind embeddings install
```

This installs `@huggingface/transformers` **once** into a shared directory
(`~/.hivemind/embed-deps/`) and symlinks every detected agent's plugin to
it, so the 600 MB cost is paid one time regardless of how many agents you
have wired up. Re-run the same command after installing a new agent and
the new symlink is added (the npm install is skipped because it's cached).

Or do it in one shot at install time:

```bash
hivemind install --with-embeddings           # all detected agents
hivemind <agent> install --with-embeddings   # a single agent
```

Other commands:

```bash
hivemind embeddings status              # show shared deps + per-agent state
hivemind embeddings uninstall           # remove the per-agent symlinks
hivemind embeddings uninstall --prune   # also delete the shared dir (~600 MB)
```

Restart your agents after enabling. From the next session, captured
messages and AI-generated summaries will include a 768-dim embedding,
and semantic recall queries will route through the local daemon (the
nomic model is downloaded on first use and cached in `~/.cache/huggingface/`).

If `@huggingface/transformers` is **not** present, Hivemind silently
degrades to lexical-only mode:

- ✅ Capture continues; rows still land in Deeplake.
- ✅ `Grep` still works via BM25 / `ILIKE` matching on text columns.
- ⚪ The `message_embedding` / `summary_embedding` columns stay `NULL`.
- ⚪ The hook log notes `embeddings: no-transformers` once at session start.

You can also force lexical-only mode explicitly with
`HIVEMIND_EMBEDDINGS=false` (useful for CI or air-gapped environments).

## Summaries

Hivemind doesn't just capture raw events — it also generates an
**AI-written wiki summary** for each session and stores it in the
`memory` table (alongside its 768-dim `summary_embedding`). The summary
is what shows up when you `Grep` for past sessions or follow links from
`~/.deeplake/memory/index.md`.

### When summaries are written

Each agent (Claude Code / Codex / Cursor / Hermes / pi) fires a wiki
worker on two triggers:

| Trigger           | When it fires                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Final**         | At session end (Stop / SessionEnd / session_shutdown), once.                  |
| **Periodic**      | Mid-session, when **either** of two thresholds is hit since the last summary: |
|                   | • messages-since-last-summary ≥ `HIVEMIND_SUMMARY_EVERY_N_MSGS` (default 50)  |
|                   | • elapsed time ≥ `HIVEMIND_SUMMARY_EVERY_HOURS` (default 2)                   |

The first message after a long pause therefore triggers a fresh
summary; long sessions naturally checkpoint every ~50 messages.

A per-session JSON sidecar at
`~/.claude/hooks/summary-state/<sessionId>.json` tracks
`{lastSummaryAt, lastSummaryCount, totalCount}`. The dir is shared
across all agents (session ids are UUIDs so no collisions). It is
**never deleted**, so resuming a session via `--resume` / `--continue`
picks up where it left off.

### How a summary is generated

1. The wiki worker queries the `sessions` table for every event tied to
   that session.
2. It builds a structured prompt asking the host agent's CLI to extract
   entities, decisions, files modified, open questions, etc.
3. It shells out to that agent's CLI (`claude -p`, `codex exec`,
   `pi --print`, …) with the prompt — never a separate API key, the
   agent's existing credentials are used.
4. The generated markdown is uploaded to the `memory` table at
   `/summaries/<user>/<sessionId>.md`. The shared embedding daemon
   produces the 768-dim `summary_embedding` so the summary is recallable
   via semantic search.

A lock file at `~/.claude/hooks/summary-state/<sessionId>.lock`
prevents two workers from running concurrently for the same session.

### Configuration

| Env var                            | Default        | Effect                                              |
|------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `HIVEMIND_SUMMARY_EVERY_N_MSGS`    | `50`           | Trigger periodic when messages-since-last ≥ this    |
| `HIVEMIND_SUMMARY_EVERY_HOURS`     | `2`            | Trigger periodic after this many hours, with ≥1 msg |
| `HIVEMIND_CURSOR_MODEL`            | `auto`         | (cursor only) model passed to `cursor-agent --print --model` |
| `HIVEMIND_HERMES_PROVIDER`         | `openrouter`   | (hermes only) provider passed to `hermes -z --provider` |
| `HIVEMIND_HERMES_MODEL`            | `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` | (hermes only) model passed to `hermes -z -m` |
| `HIVEMIND_PI_PROVIDER`             | `google`       | (pi only) provider passed to `pi --print --provider`|
| `HIVEMIND_PI_MODEL`                | `gemini-2.5-flash` | (pi only) model passed to `pi --print --model` |
| `HIVEMIND_CAPTURE=false`           | unset          | Disable both capture and summary generation         |

For pi specifically, the wiki worker is bundled separately at
`~/.pi/agent/hivemind/wiki-worker.js` (deposited by `hivemind pi install`).
The other agents ship the wiki worker inside their per-agent plugin
bundle.

## Skills (skillify)

Hivemind also crystallises **recurring patterns from your recent sessions
into reusable Claude Code skills**, automatically. Same architecture as
the wiki worker: an async background process that fires on Stop /
SessionEnd, mines recent sessions in scope, asks Haiku whether the
activity contains something worth keeping, and writes a `SKILL.md` if so.

### When the skillify worker fires

| Trigger          | When it fires                                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stop counter** | Mid-session, after every `HIVEMIND_SKILLIFY_EVERY_N_TURNS` (default 20) turns. |
| **SessionEnd**   | Always at end-of-session, regardless of counter — catches tail-of-session knowledge. |

Per-project counter state lives at
`~/.deeplake/state/skillify/<project-key>.json`. Project key is the sha1
of `git config remote.origin.url` (with the absolute path as fallback for
non-git dirs).

### How a skill is generated

1. The worker pulls the **last 10 sessions in scope** from the `sessions`
   Deeplake table — strictly newer than the watermark in the state file.
2. It strips each session to **prompt + assistant text only** (tool calls
   and thinking blocks are dropped — they're noise for skill mining).
3. It builds a gate prompt: existing project skill bodies + the 10
   stripped exchanges + decision rules.
4. It runs `claude -p haiku --permission-mode bypassPermissions` with the
   prompt. The model returns a JSON verdict:
   - `KEEP <name> <body>` — write a new skill.
   - `MERGE <existing-name> <merged-body>` — update an existing skill, bump version.
   - `SKIP <reason>` — pattern is one-off / generic / already covered.
5. On KEEP/MERGE the skill is written to `<project>/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
   (or `~/.claude/skills/...` if you've set `install` to `global`), with
   provenance frontmatter (`source_sessions`, `version`, `created_by_agent`,
   timestamps).
6. A row is also inserted into the `skills` Deeplake table for org-wide
   provenance (append-only — never UPDATE, sidesteps the
   UPDATE-coalescing quirk).

### `/skillify` — managing scope, team, install location

The `/skillify` slash command (Claude Code, Codex) and the `hivemind
skillify` CLI control mining behaviour.

```bash
hivemind skillify                            # show current scope, team, install, per-project state
hivemind skillify scope <me|team|org>        # who counts as "in scope" for mining
hivemind skillify install <project|global>   # where new skills are written
hivemind skillify promote <skill-name>       # move a project skill to ~/.claude/skills/
hivemind skillify team add <username>        # add to the team list (used when scope=team)
hivemind skillify team remove <username>     # remove from team
hivemind skillify team list                  # list current team members
```

The team list flows into the worker's session-fetch SQL: `scope=me`
filters by your own username, `scope=team` filters by `author IN
(<team>)`, `scope=org` applies no author filter.

Config persists at `~/.deeplake/state/skillify/config.json` (one global
file shared across projects).

### `pull` / `unpull` — sharing skills across the org

Once a teammate's skills are mined into the Deeplake `skills` table, you
can install them locally with `pull`. Layout written to disk:

```text
<root>/<name>--<author>/SKILL.md      ← pulled skills (e.g. deploy--alice/)
<root>/<name>/SKILL.md                ← your locally-mined skills (flat, no suffix)
```

The `--<author>` suffix keeps cross-author entries with the same name
disjoint and lets Claude Code's single-depth skill loader find pulled
skills without any symlink trickery. `<root>` is `~/.claude/skills` for
`--to global` and `<cwd>/.claude/skills` for `--to project`.

```bash
hivemind skillify pull                                # all authors, install globally
hivemind skillify pull --user alice@example.com       # only this author
hivemind skillify pull --users a@x.com,b@y.com        # multiple authors (CSV)
hivemind skillify pull --all-users                    # explicit "no author filter" (default)
hivemind skillify pull --to project                   # install under <cwd>/.claude/skills
hivemind skillify pull --dry-run                      # preview, no disk writes
hivemind skillify pull --force                        # overwrite even when local version >= remote
hivemind skillify pull <skill-name>                   # pull only that skill (combinable with --user)
```

Every successful pull records an entry in
`~/.deeplake/state/skillify/pulled.json`. That manifest is the source of
truth for `unpull` — anything not in the manifest is **never** touched
by default, even if its directory follows the `<name>--<author>` shape
(this protects user-authored variant skills like `deploy--blue-green`).

```bash
hivemind skillify unpull                              # remove every pulled entry under the install scope
hivemind skillify unpull --user alice@example.com     # remove only this author's pulls
hivemind skillify unpull --users a@x.com,b@y.com      # multiple authors
hivemind skillify unpull --not-mine                   # remove all pulls except your own
hivemind skillify unpull --dry-run                    # preview, no disk writes
hivemind skillify unpull --to project                 # operate on <cwd>/.claude/skills instead of global
hivemind skillify unpull --all                        # ALSO remove flat-layout (locally-mined) skills — destructive
hivemind skillify unpull --legacy-cleanup             # ALSO remove pre-`--author`-layout `<projectkey>/` dirs from older skillify versions
```

Drift handling: if a manifest entry's directory was deleted out-of-band
(e.g. `rm -rf` by hand), the next `unpull` reports it as `manifest-orphan`
and prunes the entry from the manifest without errors.

Cross-project caveat: same `(name, author)` from two different projects
collides on disk under the new flat layout — the more recently pulled
row wins, and the prior `SKILL.md` is preserved as `SKILL.md.bak`. The
underlying row stays in the Deeplake `skills` table, so re-pulling from
the other project recovers it.

### Auto-pull at SessionStart

Every supported agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Hermes, pi) auto-runs
the equivalent of `hivemind skillify pull --all-users --to global` at the
start of each session, so teammate-mined skills become available without
anyone having to remember to run pull manually. The pull is throttled —
by default it only fires when the previous run was more than 30 minutes
ago — and bounded by a 5-second timeout so a slow Deeplake never blocks
SessionStart. All failures (network, missing table, auth) are swallowed
silently and the session starts regardless. The last-run timestamp is
persisted at `~/.deeplake/state/skillify/autopull-last-run.json`.

| Env var                            | Default | Effect                                                   |
|------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `HIVEMIND_AUTOPULL_INTERVAL_MIN`   | `30`    | Minutes between auto-pulls. `0` runs every session, `-1` disables. |
| `HIVEMIND_AUTOPULL_DISABLED`       | unset   | Set to `1` to disable auto-pull entirely.                |

### Configuration

| Env var                              | Default | Effect                                                  |
|--------------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `HIVEMIND_SKILLIFY_EVERY_N_TURNS`     | `20`    | Stop-counter threshold for mid-session worker fires     |
| `HIVEMIND_SKILLS_TABLE`              | `skills`| Deeplake table name for org-wide provenance             |
| `HIVEMIND_SKILLIFY_WORKER=1`          | unset   | Recursion guard (set automatically inside the worker)   |
| `HIVEMIND_CURSOR_MODEL`              | `auto`  | (cursor only) model passed to the cursor-agent gate call |
| `HIVEMIND_HERMES_PROVIDER`           | `openrouter` | (hermes only) provider passed to the hermes gate call |
| `HIVEMIND_HERMES_MODEL`              | `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` | (hermes only) model passed to hermes |

### Per-agent gate CLI

The skillify worker calls each agent's own headless CLI for the gate
prompt — so a user who only has codex / cursor / hermes installed
never needs `claude` in their PATH:

| Agent       | Gate command                                                                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| claude_code | `claude -p <prompt> --no-session-persistence --model haiku --permission-mode bypassPermissions` |
| codex       | `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox <prompt>`                       |
| cursor      | `cursor-agent --print --model <HIVEMIND_CURSOR_MODEL> --force --output-format text <prompt>` |
| hermes      | `hermes -z <prompt> --provider <HIVEMIND_HERMES_PROVIDER> -m <HIVEMIND_HERMES_MODEL> --yolo --ignore-user-config` |

For hermes via OpenRouter (the default), set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in
the environment; the worker inherits the parent process env. Other
providers (anthropic, openai, etc.) need their respective API keys.

### Logs

Worker activity logs to `~/.claude/hooks/skillify.log`. Each line shows
which session pool was mined, what the gate decided, and whether a file
was written.

## Architecture

### Integration model per agent

| Agent             | Mechanism                          | Hooks/tools wired                                                                       |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Claude Code**   | Marketplace plugin                 | `SessionStart` · `UserPromptSubmit` · `PreToolUse` · `PostToolUse` · `Stop` · `SubagentStop` · `SessionEnd` |
| **Codex**         | `~/.codex/hooks.json`              | `SessionStart` · `UserPromptSubmit` · `PreToolUse(Bash)` · `PostToolUse` · `Stop`        |
| **OpenClaw**      | Native extension at `~/.openclaw/extensions/hivemind/` | `agent_end` capture · `before_agent_start` recall · contracted tools (`hivemind_search`/`read`/`index`) |
| **Cursor (1.7+)** | `~/.cursor/hooks.json`             | `sessionStart` · `beforeSubmitPrompt` · `postToolUse` · `afterAgentResponse` · `stop` · `sessionEnd` |
| **Hermes**        | Skill at `~/.hermes/skills/hivemind-memory/` | recall via grep on `~/.deeplake/memory/`                                                |
| **pi**            | `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` + skill    | recall via grep on `~/.deeplake/memory/`                                                |

## Security

- SQL values escaped with `sqlStr()`, `sqlLike()`, `sqlIdent()`
- ~70 allowlisted builtins run in the virtual FS; unrecognized commands are denied
- Credentials stored with mode `0600`, config dir with mode `0700`
- Device flow login: no tokens in environment or code
- `HIVEMIND_CAPTURE=false` fully disables data collection
