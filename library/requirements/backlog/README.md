# Requirements — Backlog

Planned PRDs not yet in implementation. All new PRD folders are created here.

## Creating a new PRD

1. Find `max_n` across `backlog/prd-*/`, `in-work/prd-*/`, `completed/prd-*/`.
2. Create `prd-<max_n + 1>-<kebab-slug>/`.
3. Create `prd-<###>-<slug>-index.md` (module overview + feature list).
4. Create `qa/` subfolder (empty; `quality-guardian` writes reports here).
5. Add sub-PRDs `prd-<###>a-<slug>-<feature>.md` etc. as needed.
