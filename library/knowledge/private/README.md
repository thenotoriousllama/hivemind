  This folder contains internal engineering and business documentation.
  ADRs MUST live in architecture/ADR-<n>-<kebab-slug>.md.
  Engineering standards MUST live in standards/documentation-framework.md.
  Other domain folders (<domain>/) are repo-specific and may be created as
  needed (ai/, auth/, data/, frontend/, infrastructure/, integrations/,
  marketing/, operations/, personas/, reporting/, roadmap/, scanners/,
  security/, strategy/, etc.).
  Do NOT file customer-facing content here (that goes in knowledge/public/).
  Write path: library/knowledge/private/<domain>/<kebab-slug>.md.

  Internal engineering and business documentation.
  - architecture/: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
  - standards/: Documentation framework and coding standards
  - <domain>/: Any repo-specific knowledge domain (ai/, auth/, data/, etc.)
  Default landing zone for any doc that does not need to be customer-facing.
  When creating a new domain folder, add a README.md explaining what belongs.
