## Why this pipeline exists

Hivemind is built as a single TypeScript monorepo that supports six different coding assistants. Each assistant requires its own specific plugin structure, files layout, and distribution format. To deliver optimal performance, reduce memory overhead, and ensure near-instant startup times inside resource-constrained IDE environments, Hivemind implements a two-stage compilation and bundling process:

1. **Type Checking and Compilation (`tsc`):** The TypeScript compiler compiles the entire shared core and agent shims, verifying type safety and emitting modular JavaScript to the `dist/` directory.
2. **Bundling (`esbuild`):** An esbuild script gathers the compiled outputs and bundles them into self-contained, optimized, and executable modules. This step drops unused code, resolves imports, and generates independent plugin bundles for each platform.

This approach keeps the source code maintainable in a unified monorepo while delivering custom-tailored, self-contained, and highly optimized artifacts to the respective host assistants.

## Pipeline Execution

The entry point of the build process is defined in the workspace `package.json` scripts:

```33:50:package.json
  "scripts": {
    "prebuild": "node scripts/sync-versions.mjs",
    "build": "tsc && node esbuild.config.mjs",
    "bundle": "node esbuild.config.mjs",
    "dev": "tsc --watch",
    "shell": "tsx src/shell/deeplake-shell.ts",
    "cli": "tsx src/cli/index.ts",
    "test": "vitest run",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "dup": "jscpd src",
    "audit:openclaw": "node scripts/audit-openclaw-bundle.mjs",
    "pack:check": "node scripts/pack-check.mjs",
    "rebuild:native": "node scripts/ensure-tree-sitter.mjs",
    "ci": "npm run typecheck && npm run dup && npm test",
    "postinstall": "node scripts/ensure-tree-sitter.mjs",
    "prepare": "husky && npm run build",
    "prepack": "npm run build"
  },
```

---

## Version Synchronization

To keep the release version in sync across the entire ecosystem, the `prebuild` hook runs a dedicated version sync script. This script reads the version number from the main `package.json` file and propagates it to all plugin manifest files:

```13:25:scripts/sync-versions.mjs
const SOURCE = "package.json";

// Scalar targets: each has a single top-level `version` field tracking package.json.
export const SCALAR_TARGETS = [
  ".claude-plugin/plugin.json",
  "harnesses/claude-code/.claude-plugin/plugin.json",
  "harnesses/openclaw/openclaw.plugin.json",
  "harnesses/openclaw/package.json",
  "harnesses/codex/package.json",
];
```

The script is idempotent. It parses the JSON manifests, verifies whether the target version matches, and performs the file write only if there is a discrepancy. It also updates the marketplace definition file:

```63:88:scripts/sync-versions.mjs
  const marketplace = readJsonAt(root, MARKETPLACE_PATH);
  let mpChanged = false;
  if (marketplace.metadata?.version !== version) {
    const old = marketplace.metadata?.version;
    marketplace.metadata = marketplace.metadata || {};
    marketplace.metadata.version = version;
    log(`sync-versions: ${MARKETPLACE_PATH} metadata.version: ${old} -> ${version}`);
    mpChanged = true;
  }
  if (Array.isArray(marketplace.plugins)) {
    for (const plugin of marketplace.plugins) {
      if (plugin.version !== version) {
        const old = plugin.version;
        plugin.version = version;
        log(`sync-versions: ${MARKETPLACE_PATH} plugins[${plugin.name}].version: ${old} -> ${version}`);
        mpChanged = true;
      }
    }
  }
  if (mpChanged) {
    writeJsonAt(root, MARKETPLACE_PATH, marketplace);
    writes++;
  } else {
    log(`sync-versions: ${MARKETPLACE_PATH} already at ${version}`);
    skips++;
  }
```

## Bundling with Esbuild

The core bundling engine is `esbuild.config.mjs`. It orchestrates compilation configs for the different targets, matching their runtime requirements and dependencies.

### Output Bundles and Targets

Esbuild generates separate distribution bundles under the following directories:

* **Claude Code:** Generated under `harnesses/claude-code/bundle/`. It packs hooks like `session-start`, `session-end`, `pre-tool-use`, `capture`, and several specialized background workers.
* **Codex:** Generated under `harnesses/codex/bundle/`. It includes the Codex-specific lifecycle shims and background tasks.
* **Cursor:** Generated under `cursor/bundle/`. It packages the `session-start`, `capture`, `pre-tool-use`, `session-end`, and `graph-on-stop` hooks.
* **Hermes Agent:** Generated under `harnesses/hermes/bundle/`. It bundles hooks following the NousResearch/hermes-agent shell hook protocol.
* **pi:** Generated under `harnesses/pi/bundle/`. It bundles background workers like the `wiki-worker` and `skillify-worker`. (The main pi extension runs raw TypeScript compiled by pi's runtime.)
* **OpenClaw:** Generated under `harnesses/openclaw/dist/`. It outputs the compiled HTTP/WebSocket plugin gateway, along with its async `skillify-worker`.
* **MCP Server:** Generated under `mcp/bundle/`. It builds the standalone Model Context Protocol server that can be hooked into Cline, Roo, or Kilo.
* **Unified CLI:** Generated under `bundle/`. It produces the primary `hivemind` executable binary.
* **Embed Daemon:** Generated under `embeddings/`. It compiles the standalone semantic search background daemon.

### Handling Native Dependencies

A major challenge in bundling Hivemind is its dependency on native Node modules. Specifically, the codebase graph extractor uses `tree-sitter` and various language grammars, which compile down to native binary files (`.node` assets). 

Because esbuild cannot bundle native binaries into a pure JavaScript module, these dependencies are declared as `external` in the esbuild configurations. At runtime, the bundles resolve these dependencies from `node_modules` on the host machine.

```52:82:esbuild.config.mjs
await build({
  entryPoints: Object.fromEntries(ccAll.map(h => [h.out, h.entry])),
  bundle: true,
  platform: "node",
  format: "esm",
  outdir: "harnesses/claude-code/bundle",
  external: [
    "node:*",
    "node-liblzma",
    "@mongodb-js/zstd",
    "@huggingface/transformers",
    "onnxruntime-node",
    "onnxruntime-common",
    "sharp",
    // tree-sitter and language grammars ship native .node prebuilds that
    // esbuild cannot bundle. Resolved from node_modules at runtime.
    "tree-sitter",
    "tree-sitter-typescript",
    "tree-sitter-javascript",
    "tree-sitter-python",
    "tree-sitter-go",
    "tree-sitter-rust",
    "tree-sitter-java",
    "tree-sitter-ruby",
    "tree-sitter-c",
    "tree-sitter-cpp",
  ],
  define: {
    __HIVEMIND_VERSION__: JSON.stringify(hivemindVersion),
  },
});
```

## OpenClaw Specialized Bundling and Security

The OpenClaw gateway operates under a strict sandbox model. This requires advanced optimizations and security overrides during compilation.

### Stubbing Node Processes

The shared core contains utilities that invoke sub-processes, such as opening browser tabs during login or launching background workers. In OpenClaw, these actions are disallowed or unneeded because it is a remote gateway. 

To eliminate unreachable code that would trigger security warnings on the ClawHub registry, esbuild uses a custom plugin to stub the native `node:child_process` module:

```404:426:esbuild.config.mjs
  plugins: [{
    // Dead-code elimination for transitively bundled CC/Codex-only features.
    // harnesses/openclaw/src/index.ts imports shared modules from ../../src/ (DeeplakeApi,
    // grep-core, virtual-table-query, auth device-flow). Several of those
    // modules also host CC-specific helpers that shell out with execSync —
    // opening the browser for SSO, nudging claude-plugin-update, spawning the
    // wiki-worker daemon. Those helpers are never called through the openclaw
    // entry point (openclaw is a pure HTTP/WebSocket gateway; it has no local
    // browser, uses its own plugin installer, and does not run the wiki-worker
    // daemon). Replacing node:child_process with a no-op export drops that
    // dead code from the bundle instead of shipping unreachable exec calls.
    name: "stub-unused-child-process",
    setup(build) {
      build.onResolve({ filter: /^node:child_process$/ }, () => ({
        path: "node:child_process",
        namespace: "stub",
      }));
      build.onLoad({ filter: /.*/, namespace: "stub" }, () => ({
        contents: "export const execSync = () => {}; export const execFileSync = () => {}; export const spawn = () => {};",
        loader: "js",
      }));
    },
  }],
```

### Global Environment Dispatch

The ClawHub scanner blocks uploads containing raw `process.env` lookups alongside network queries to prevent credential harvesting. To bypass this, the esbuild configuration rewrites all environment variable lookups into properties on a global tuning object:

```371:403:esbuild.config.mjs
    // ----- User-tunable knobs: routed through a globalThis dispatch -----
    // Every read of `process.env.HIVEMIND_X` in transitively-bundled code is
    // rewritten by esbuild to `globalThis.__hivemind_tuning__.HIVEMIND_X`.
    // The openclaw plugin's `register()` populates that object from
    // `pluginApi.pluginConfig.tuning` (i.e. what the user wrote under
    // `plugins.entries.hivemind.config.tuning` in `openclaw.json`). So the
    // bundle has zero `process.env.X` substrings (ClawHub scan passes), AND
    // the user can still tune at runtime by editing openclaw.json + restart.
    // CodeRabbit + @efenocchi on #170 pushed back on the previous
    // inline-to-undefined approach because it removed the env-override
    // surface entirely. This restores it via a different mechanism.
    "process.env.HIVEMIND_DEBUG": "globalThis.__hivemind_tuning__.HIVEMIND_DEBUG",
    "process.env.HIVEMIND_TRACE_SQL": "globalThis.__hivemind_tuning__.HIVEMIND_TRACE_SQL",
    "process.env.HIVEMIND_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS": "globalThis.__hivemind_tuning__.HIVEMIND_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS",
    "process.env.HIVEMIND_INDEX_MARKER_TTL_MS": "globalThis.__hivemind_tuning__.HIVEMIND_INDEX_MARKER_TTL_MS",
    "process.env.HIVEMIND_INDEX_MARKER_DIR": "globalThis.__hivemind_tuning__.HIVEMIND_INDEX_MARKER_DIR",
    "process.env.HIVEMIND_SEMANTIC_LIMIT": "globalThis.__hivemind_tuning__.HIVEMIND_SEMANTIC_LIMIT",
    "process.env.HIVEMIND_HYBRID_LEXICAL_LIMIT": "globalThis.__hivemind_tuning__.HIVEMIND_HYBRID_LEXICAL_LIMIT",
    "process.env.HIVEMIND_GREP_LIKE": "globalThis.__hivemind_tuning__.HIVEMIND_GREP_LIKE",
    "process.env.HIVEMIND_SEMANTIC_SEARCH": "globalThis.__hivemind_tuning__.HIVEMIND_SEMANTIC_SEARCH",
    "process.env.HIVEMIND_SEMANTIC_EMBED_TIMEOUT_MS": "globalThis.__hivemind_tuning__.HIVEMIND_SEMANTIC_EMBED_TIMEOUT_MS",
    "process.env.HIVEMIND_SEMANTIC_EMIT_ALL": "globalThis.__hivemind_tuning__.HIVEMIND_SEMANTIC_EMIT_ALL",
    // `HIVEMIND_STATE_DIR` is the test-isolation override that points
    // `~/.deeplake/state/skillify` at a `mkdtempSync()` dir. OpenClaw has
    // no testing surface and no reason to redirect state, so it always
    // resolves to `undefined` at runtime — the call-site `??
    // homedir()/...` fallback produces the production path. The rewrite
    // matters mainly to keep the ClawHub `env-harvesting` scanner happy:
    // a literal `process.env.HIVEMIND_STATE_DIR` substring in the same
    // file as a network send trips the critical rule even though the
    // value is just a directory path.
    "process.env.HIVEMIND_STATE_DIR": "globalThis.__hivemind_tuning__.HIVEMIND_STATE_DIR",
```

## Distribution and Post-Install Processes

When the user runs `npm install -g @deeplake/hivemind`, the global package is laid down on their machine.

A `postinstall` script immediately invokes `node scripts/ensure-tree-sitter.mjs`. This script checks the host OS, ensures that correct binary prebuilds for `tree-sitter` and the language grammars are download-resolved, and handles potential compilation fallback steps.

The CLI binary is exposed via the `bin` field in `package.json`, which points to `bundle/cli.js`. This file is generated with an executable permission stamp `0755` and a standard hash-bang line pointing to the Node.js interpreter, ensuring a seamless terminal execution experience.
