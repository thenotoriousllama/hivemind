/**
 * Bundle-level anti-regression for the periodic-summary feature. These
 * tests scan the SHIPPED bundles (claude-code + codex) to confirm:
 *
 * 1. The SessionEnd race fix is present: before spawning the worker, the
 *    hook checks tryAcquireLock and bails when another worker is running.
 *    Two concurrent workers writing the same summary row trip the Deeplake
 *    UPDATE-coalescing quirk and drop one write.
 *
 * 2. The periodic trigger in the capture hook also acquires the lock
 *    before spawning — same reason.
 *
 * 3. The internal wiki-worker flag uses ONLY the new HIVEMIND_WIKI_WORKER
 *    name. DEEPLAKE_WIKI_WORKER was a migration-only fallback and is a
 *    plugin-internal signal, so there is no reason to keep it shipped.
 *
 * 4. HIVEMIND_CAPTURE=false is respected everywhere the guard existed —
 *    the rename left one path reading the old name only, which we fixed.
 *
 * Source tests (summary-state.test.ts) prove the lock module is correct;
 * these bundle checks prove the build didn't drop the call sites.
