/**
 * Contract lock-in for the `## Next Steps` instruction in the wiki-worker
 * prompt. This section is the sole source of the resume "pick up where you
 * left off" pointer, so over-generous wording here is exactly what produces
 * false-positive next steps in the SessionStart brief.
 *
 * The prompt lives in FIVE hand-maintained copies (claude / codex / cursor /
 * hermes, plus the pi extension which ships as raw TypeScript and is read at
 * the source level here). The intros differ slightly per agent, but the
 * `## Next Steps` block must stay byte-identical across all five — a copy
 * drifting back to looser wording (or, as pi originally did, omitting the
 * section entirely) silently reopens the false-positive path for that agent.
 * These tests guard both the contract and the cross-copy sync.
