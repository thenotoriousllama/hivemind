/**
 * Bundle-level regression guard for fix #3 — the shell bundle invoked by the
 * pre-tool-use hook as `node shell-bundle -c "..."` must not leak
 * `[deeplake-sql]` trace output onto stderr. Claude Code's Bash tool merges
 * the child process's stderr into the tool_result string the model sees, so
 * any trace line shows up as noise in Claude's view of the command output
 * (observed in the original `baseline_cloud-100` transcripts, where 35+
 * lines of `[deeplake-sql]` noise polluted bash command results).
 *
 * The fix has two parts:
 *   1. `traceSql` reads the HIVEMIND_TRACE_SQL / HIVEMIND_DEBUG env vars at
 *      call time (not at module load), so callers can turn tracing off after
 *      importing the SDK.
 *   2. The shell bundle's one-shot entry point (`node ... -c "cmd"`) deletes
 *      those env vars before opening any SQL connection.
 *
 * This test spawns the shipped shell bundle with the trace vars set
 * explicitly, runs a trivial command that's guaranteed not to touch the
 * network (we point the SDK at an unreachable URL and expect the command to
 * fail fast), and asserts that the combined stderr output contains zero
 * `[deeplake-sql]` lines. If either fix is reverted, stderr fills with the
 * trace messages and the test fails.
