/**
 * Every agent builds its own `sessions` INSERT as an inline SQL string — a
 * hand-maintained copy of the canonical column set. The `pi` extension already
 * shipped exactly this drift: its INSERT wrote `plugin_version` while its
 * CREATE/heal did not, so every pi sessions table was one column short and every
 * INSERT failed permanently with `column "plugin_version" ... does not exist`
 * (42703). (pi has its own INSERT ⊆ CREATE guard in tests/pi.)
 *
 * The shared-path agents below derive their CREATE TABLE and schema-heal from
 * SESSIONS_COLUMNS, so the invariant that keeps them safe is: every column an
 * INSERT writes must exist in SESSIONS_COLUMNS — otherwise CREATE/heal never
 * create it and the write 42703s. Lock it so the pi bug can't reappear here.
