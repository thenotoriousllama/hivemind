/**
 * Drift detection for pi's mirror of SKILLIFY_COMMANDS.
 *
 * pi's extension ships as a single self-contained .ts file loaded by pi's
 * runtime, so it can't import the canonical spec from src/cli/. Instead
 * it keeps a hand-maintained mirror called PI_SKILLIFY_COMMANDS. This test
 * fails the build if the two lists fall out of sync — adding a new
 * subcommand to the spec without updating pi is the most likely way they
 * drift.
