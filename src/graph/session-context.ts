/**
 * SessionStart inject for the local code graph (Phase 3 v1.1).
 *
 * Goal: surface the graph to Claude on every SessionStart so it knows the
 * snapshot exists and can read it directly for code-relationship questions
 * ("what calls X?", "what imports Y?") instead of grepping the source tree.
 *
 * Hot-path constraint: SessionStart inject runs on EVERY session start. We
 * cannot afford to parse the ~1 MB snapshot JSON here. Instead we read the
 * small `.last-build.json` file (single small read, fields already populated
 * by writeSnapshot).
 *
 * Real cost: low-single-digit milliseconds, NOT sub-millisecond. The
 * dominant term is deriveProjectKey() which shells out to `git config --get
 * remote.origin.url`; the .last-build.json read itself is sub-ms. The git
 * call is already paid by the graph-on-stop hook on the same SessionStart,
 * so the marginal cost here is negligible.
 *
 * Tampered-file defence: `commit_sha` and `snapshot_sha256` are validated
 * as hex by readLastBuild (see src/graph/last-build.ts). Without that
 * validation, an attacker who writes a shape-valid .last-build.json with
 * embedded newlines into `commit_sha` could inject text directly into the
 * system prompt, or escape the snapshots/ dir via "../" in either hash.
 * Both vectors are closed at the parser, not here — but we still defensively
 * truncate when rendering.
 *
 * Honest scope hints in the inject text:
 *   - "TypeScript only" — Phase 1 limitation, makes Claude not waste a Read
 *     on Python/Rust expecting to find them in the graph.
 *   - "AST-based" — call/import/reference edges; NOT semantic similarity.
 *     The semantic layer is a deliberate v1.2 follow-up.
 *   - "may be stale" — the graph is rebuilt at most once per
 *     HIVEMIND_GRAPH_TICK_INTERVAL_MS (default 10 min) so it can lag
 *     uncommitted in-flight edits. The age line lets Claude judge.
 *
 * Returns null when:
 *   - no graph has ever been built for this repo
 *   - the cwd isn't a recognizable project (deriveProjectKey fallback)
 *   - the last-build file is missing/corrupt
 * — in all these cases SessionStart simply skips the inject.
