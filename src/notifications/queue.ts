/**
 * Atomic file-backed queue at ~/.deeplake/notifications-queue.json.

 * Producers (any code path) call `enqueueNotification(n)`. Consumers (the

 * commit a drain. FIFO order. Atomic write same as state.ts.

 * Why a file rather than an in-process bus: producers and consumers may
 * live in DIFFERENT processes (capture hook produces; session-notifications
 * hook consumes at next session). The file is the cross-process boundary.
