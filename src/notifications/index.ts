/**
 * Public API for the notifications framework.
 *
 * Two production code paths use this module:
 *   1. The hook entry point (e.g. src/hooks/session-notifications.ts) calls
 *      drainSessionStart() once per session start.
 *   2. Any code path can call enqueueNotification() at any time to push
 *      a notification onto the persistent queue, drained at the next session.
 *
 * Rule registration (registerRule) currently happens at module-load time
 * inside drainSessionStart's caller — see hooks/session-notifications.ts.
 * Rules are pure (no IO) so a cold registry-evaluation has zero side effects
 * if no rule fires.
