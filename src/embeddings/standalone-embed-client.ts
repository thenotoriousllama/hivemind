// Read-only embedding client for agents that don't bundle a daemon of
// their own (pi extension source, openclaw plugin). Talks to the same
// per-user Unix socket as `src/embeddings/client.ts`, and — when the
// socket is absent — auto-spawns the canonical shared daemon at
// `~/.hivemind/embed-deps/embed-daemon.js` (deposited by
// `hivemind embeddings install`).
//
// Differences from `client.ts`:
//   - No hello/handshake. These callers don't recycle stuck daemons:
//     they connect, embed, and disconnect. Recycling is the hot-path
//     client's job — having two recycle paths would race.
//   - No singleton, no notification side-effects. Each call is
//     independent and returns null on any failure.
//   - No SIGTERM on stale-pidfile-with-live-PID. Same PID-reuse risk
//     PR #168 fixed in client.ts: if the socket is gone the daemon
//     process is also gone, and the PID we captured may already have
//     been recycled by the OS to an unrelated user process.
//
// Hard requirement: callers MUST treat a null return as "skip embedding
// column" — never block the write path on us.
