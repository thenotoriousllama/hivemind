/**
 * Read helpers for `hivemind_rules`.
 *
 * The table is append-only with a per-rule version monotone (see ./write.ts).
 * Reads always pick the latest row per `rule_id`. v1 fetches all rows and
 * deduplicates in JS — simple, portable across whatever subset of Postgres
 * window functions Deeplake exposes, and fast enough at the expected v1
 * scale (org rule counts measured in tens, not thousands).
 *
 * The lookup index `(rule_id, version)` (created by `ensureRulesTable`)
 * keeps the SELECT cheap as the table grows; if v1.1 ever exceeds JS-dedup
 * comfort, swap in a window-function SELECT — the row shape is unchanged.
