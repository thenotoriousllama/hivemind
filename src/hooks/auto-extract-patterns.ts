/**
 * Pattern allow-list for the PostToolUse auto-extract pipeline.
 *
 * v1 ships exactly ONE pattern: `gh pr merge`. The rationale (from the
 * plan, A6 + failure-modes table):
 *
 *   - `gh pr merge` is high-signal — it produces a PR-merge event in
 *     the real world and is rare enough that a false positive (e.g.
 *     the user typing the literal string into a chat or doc) is
 *     vanishingly unlikely. Anyone running it intends to merge.
 *
 *   - `git push` is intentionally NOT in the allow-list. The same
 *     command runs against personal branches, force-pushes, and
 *     experiments — counting every `git push` as KPI progress would
 *     inflate counts beyond meaning.
 *
 *   - A future v1.1 may grow the list; each addition needs a
 *     true-positive test AND a false-positive test in
 *     tests/shared/auto-extract.test.ts before it lands.
 *
 * The patterns are agent-agnostic: this module exports a regex over
 * the *command string* (not the wrapping tool name). The caller —
 * src/hooks/capture.ts in T5 — is responsible for extracting the
 * command from whatever shape the hook delivers (PostToolUse for
 * Claude Code, post-shell hook for Codex, etc.). That keeps the
 * pattern list one source of truth across agents.
