/**
 * Auto-build hook for the codebase-graph feature (Phase 1.5).
 *
 * Registered in harnesses/claude-code/hooks/hooks.json under BOTH "Stop" AND
 * "SessionEnd" with async: true. Why both:
 *   - "Stop" fires after every model turn in INTERACTIVE Claude sessions.
 *     Rate-limit gate (10 min default) keeps the per-turn cost ~5ms in
 *     the skip path; you get near-real-time graph freshness while coding.
 *   - "SessionEnd" fires at session close. It's the ONLY end-of-session
 *     event that fires in `claude -p` non-interactive mode (where Stop
 *     is skipped). Without this registration `claude -p --plugin-dir`
 *     would run the agent and exit without ever rebuilding the graph.
 *
 * Double-firing race: at session close, Stop fires (async) THEN SessionEnd
 * fires (async) almost simultaneously. Both processes read the pre-build
 * .last-build.json and both pass the gate. Without protection, both would
 * run a full build in parallel.
 *
 * Mitigation: cross-process build lock via acquireBuildLock(). Atomic
 * O_CREAT|O_EXCL on `.build.in-flight`. First-to-acquire runs the build;
 * the other logs "lock held-by-other" and exits without work. Stale locks
 * (process crashed mid-build) are auto-recovered after 5 minutes. See
 * src/graph/build-lock.ts.
 *
 * Common-case workload (when the gate skips):
 *
 *   1. Read ~/.hivemind/graphs/<key>/.last-build.json
 *   2. If now - lastBuild.ts < TICK_INTERVAL_MS → exit 0 (rate limit)
 *   3. Get HEAD via git rev-parse. If null → exit 0 (not in a git repo)
 *   4. If HEAD == lastBuild.commit_sha → exit 0 (no new commits)
 *   5. If `git diff --name-only <last-commit>..HEAD -- '*.ts' '*.tsx' | wc -l` < 1
 *      → exit 0 (threshold gate; only commit-touched source files trigger)
 *   6. Otherwise: run the build inline (cache makes warm rebuild ~85ms)
 *
 * Total cost on a "skip" path: ~5ms (one file read + one git call).
 * Total cost on a "build" path: ~85ms warm / ~2.5s cold (full rebuild).
 *
 * Important: this hook does NOT block Claude Code (async: true) and never
 * blocks the user. Errors are logged to .graph-on-stop.log and swallowed —
 * a buggy hook must never break the user's session.
 *
 * Process model: runs in-process (no detached spawn). With async: true,
 * Claude Code launches us and moves on; we run to completion in our own
 * lifetime and exit. No daemon, no PID file, no cross-platform issues.
