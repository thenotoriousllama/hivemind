/**
 * Claude Code SessionStart hook entry point — notifications channel.
 *
 * Wired as a SECOND SessionStart hook command in claude-code/hooks/hooks.json,
 * alongside the existing memory/hivemind hook (session-start.js).
 *
 * Bundle target: bundle/session-notifications.js. See esbuild.config.mjs.
 *
 * Failure isolation: any error here is swallowed and the process exits 0.
 * The sibling memory/hivemind hook is not affected.
