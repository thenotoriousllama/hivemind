/**
 * Weekly, user-side, SessionStart-triggered auto-firing of the SkillOpt loop.
 *
 * Mirrors the skillify worker pattern: at SessionStart we check a once-a-week throttle and, if due,
 * spawn a DETACHED background worker that runs the loop (detect a deficient skill -> optimizer
 * proposes a fix -> real-rollout gate -> silent publish). It uses the USER's own agent (claude -p /
 * codex), so no org API key is needed and cost lands on the user — exactly like skillify mining.
 *
 * SessionStart safety: this NEVER blocks. It does one cheap state read, optionally spawns a detached
 * + unref'd child, and returns. All failures swallowed. Opt-out: HIVEMIND_SKILLOPT_DISABLED=1.
