/**
 * Shared accessor for the `mine-local` manifest at
 * ~/.claude/hivemind/local-mined.json.
 *
 * The manifest does triple duty:
 *   1. One-shot sentinel — `hivemind skillify mine-local` refuses to
 *      re-run when the file exists (unless `--force` is passed).
 *   2. Provenance index — records every locally-mined skill's canonical
 *      path, source sessions, fan-out symlinks, and gate metadata for a
 *      future `push-local` flow (uploads `uploaded:false` rows after
 *      sign-in).
 *   3. Read-only hint surface — the per-agent SessionStart hooks read
 *      the entry count when no credentials are present and surface it
 *      as part of the "not logged in" injection: "You have N local
 *      skills. Sign in to share new ones."
 *
 * Pulled out of `src/commands/mine-local.ts` so the session-start hooks
 * don't have to depend on the CLI orchestrator (which transitively
 * imports the gate runner, parallelMap, etc. — heavy for a hook).
