/**
 * #4 (redesigned) — the TARGETED core: judge ONE skill against the user's reaction
 * and improve it immediately if it failed. No anchor, no counter, no org-wide sweep.
 *
 * Flow: an org skill X was invoked → the user reacted → judge X's window (the LLM is
 * the only evaluator now — a regex can't catch "you fucked up again") with the
 * just-submitted reaction appended (it lags Deeplake, so it's passed in straight from
 * the hook). If the judge says the task FAILED, read X's current body, propose a
 * bounded edit, and publish v+1 — right then. The meta-dedup stops re-publishing the
 * same edit when the next reaction re-judges the same window.
 *
 * Everything is injected (query, judge/proposer models, meta) so this is unit-tested
 * with no Deeplake / LLM.
