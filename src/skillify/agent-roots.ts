/**
 * Detect skill discovery roots for non-Claude agents installed on this
 * machine. Used by the pull fan-out to symlink each pulled skill into
 * every agent's native skills directory so the same canonical SKILL.md
 * (under ~/.claude/skills/) is discoverable by Codex, Hermes, and pi.
 *
 * Marker-based detection: we look for each agent's *config* directory
 * (`~/.codex`, `~/.hermes`, `~/.pi/agent`) rather than its skills
 * subdirectory. The skills dir isn't a reliable detector by itself:
 *   - codex installer creates `~/.agents/skills/` on first install,
 *     so existence of THAT path implies codex (or some agentskills.io
 *     consumer) has run.
 *   - hermes installer creates `~/.hermes/skills/hivemind-memory/`,
 *     so its skills root exists post-install.
 *   - pi installer does NOT create `~/.pi/agent/skills/` — pi
 *     populates that lazily as the user installs individual skills.
 *     So a fresh pi+hivemind box would have `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`
 *     and `~/.pi/agent/hivemind/` but no `skills/`. Existence-based
 *     detection on the skills dir would silently skip pi for this
 *     user, leaving pi without any pulled skills until they happened
 *     to mkdir it themselves.
 *
 * The Claude Code root (`~/.claude/skills/`) is excluded because the
 * canonical write location IS that path; symlinking a skill into itself
 * would be a no-op at best and a self-referential loop at worst.
 *
 * Cursor discovers skills under `~/.cursor/skills-cursor/` (global) and
 * `<project>/.cursor/skills/` (project). When `~/.cursor` exists, the
 * global Cursor root is included; when `projectRoot` is passed, the
 * project Cursor root is included as well.

/**

 * detected — both consume the agentskills.io shared layout, but only
 * codex's installer creates that directory. On a pi-only box without
 * codex, the dir wouldn't otherwise exist; we still want pi to see
 * pulled skills via that path because pi's runtime reads from it.
 * `fanOutSymlinks` upstream calls `mkdirSync(dirname(link), { recursive })`
