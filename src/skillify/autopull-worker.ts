/**
 * Standalone entrypoint that runs `maybeAutoPull()` once and exits.
 * Bundled by esbuild for agents that can't import the shared module
 * (currently just pi, which ships its extension as raw .ts with zero
 * non-builtin runtime dependencies — see pi/extension-source/hivemind.ts).
 *
 * Pi spawns this synchronously from session_start and waits for it to
 * exit before assembling the additionalContext payload. That mirrors
 * the in-process `await maybeAutoPull()` that codex / cursor / hermes
 * do directly — pi just routes through a child process because it
 * can't link the TypeScript code at extension-load time.
 *
 * The pull's 5-second internal timeout is the upper bound on this
 * worker's runtime; the parent's spawnSync should set a slightly
 * larger wall-clock cap (~6s) as a defence-in-depth measure.
 *
 * Always exits 0 — failures are already swallowed inside maybeAutoPull.
 * The parent shouldn't react to the exit code.
