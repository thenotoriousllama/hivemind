/**
 * Manifest of skills installed via `hivemind skillify pull`.
 *
 * Why a manifest instead of just heuristics on directory names:
 * the `<name>--<author>/` convention used by `pull` is a legitimate
 * naming pattern that anyone can use for variant or sub-purpose skills
 * (e.g. `deploy--blue-green`, `test--integration`). Inferring "this is
 * a pull-managed entry" purely from the presence of `--` would let
 * `unpull` accidentally remove user-authored skills with that naming
 * style. The manifest gives `unpull` an authoritative list of what
 * skillify actually wrote, so anything outside that list is left alone.
 *
 * File: ~/.deeplake/state/skillify/pulled.json
 *
 * Atomicity: writes go to a sibling .tmp file and rename in place, so
 * a crash mid-write leaves either the pre-write state or the new state
 * intact (no torn JSON).
