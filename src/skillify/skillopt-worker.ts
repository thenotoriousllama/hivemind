/**
 * Detached, targeted SkillOpt worker (spawned by skillopt-trigger on a user reaction).
 * Given one session + one ORG skill X + the user's reaction, it:
 *   1. judges X's window against the reaction (the LLM is the only evaluator)
 *   2. if the task FAILED, reads X's current body, proposes a bounded edit, and
 *      publishes v+1 DIRECTLY to the org skills table — right then.
 *
 * Runs on the USER's own agent (claude/codex/hermes/cursor/pi) — no org key, cost lands
 * on the user. HIVEMIND_SKILLOPT_WORKER=1 is set by the trigger as a recursion guard.
 * Inputs come via env: HIVEMIND_SKILLOPT_{SESSION,SKILL,REACTION,AGENT}.
