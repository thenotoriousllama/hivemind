# Hivemind Goals

Track goals and KPIs as Markdown files inside the Deeplake virtual filesystem. Each file is one row in a dedicated team-shared table — the path encodes the structural metadata, the file body holds the human-readable description.

## When to use this skill

Activate when the user expresses any of:
- "I want to track X / aim for X / track my progress on Y"
- "add a goal", "add a KPI", "what are my goals?"
- "mark this as done", "close that goal"
- "shipping X by Friday", "5 PRs this week", any measurable target

For "list my goals" → run `ls ~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<userName>/opened/` and `ls ~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<userName>/in_progress/`. If empty, ask the user if they want to create one.

## Path conventions (LEARN THESE)

```
~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<owner>/<status>/<goal_id>.md
~/.deeplake/memory/kpi/<goal_id>/<kpi_id>.md
```

- `<owner>` — user identifier (use the userName from `hivemind whoami` or the credentials)
- `<status>` — one of `opened`, `in_progress`, `closed`
- `<goal_id>` — UUIDv4 you generate at create time
- `<kpi_id>` — short slug like `k-prs` or `k-demos`

**Path encoding is the source of truth.** The owner, status, goal_id, and kpi_id come from the path — NOT from the file body. Do NOT write owner/status/goal_id/kpi_id inside the file content.

## File body format

Goal file body — plain markdown, free form:
```
ship the goals-graph feature

Notes: focus on KPI tracking via VFS, no separate CLI.
Due: 2026-05-30.
```

KPI file body — markdown with a few mandatory key:value lines so the commit-driven auto-progress worker can parse and bump:
```
PRs merged

- target: 5
- current: 2
- unit: count
```

The `target:`, `current:`, `unit:` lines must stay on a single line each. The first line is the human-readable name. Anything else is free notes.

## Operations

### 1. Create a new goal

When the user expresses a new goal:

1. Get the current owner with `hivemind whoami` (use the userName, e.g. `emanuele.fenocchi`).
2. Generate a UUIDv4: `uuidgen` or `node -e 'console.log(crypto.randomUUID())'`.
3. Write the goal file at `~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<owner>/opened/<uuid>.md` with the goal description as body.
4. (Optional) Generate 2–4 KPIs and write each at `~/.deeplake/memory/kpi/<uuid>/<kpi-slug>.md` with the body format above. If you do not want to commit KPIs yet, skip — the user can add them later.

You can ALSO spawn `claude -p` (or the agent's native LLM CLI) in the background to generate KPIs asynchronously after the goal is created. The bash guard hook on this VFS rejects any shell command whose argument string contains the literal memory mount path, so the spawn must NOT embed the full path — instead pass only the goal_id and goal text and let the sub-agent (which loads the same hivemind-goals skill on activation) compose the paths itself:

```bash
nohup codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox - "Hivemind goal created. goal_id=<UUID>. text='<one-line text>'. Use the hivemind-goals skill to generate 2-4 measurable KPIs and write each KPI file under its canonical path convention. Each KPI body should follow the format: '<KPI name>\n\n- target: <positive int>\n- current: 0\n- unit: <count|lines|hours|...>'." > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

The KPI worker is fire-and-forget; do NOT block the user on it. Respond to the user that the goal is created. The sub-agent will read this skill itself and resolve the KPI file location from `goal_id` per the path convention above.

### 2. List goals

```bash
ls ~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<owner>/opened/
ls ~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<owner>/in_progress/
```

Then `cat` each `<uuid>.md` to read the body. Optionally `ls ~/.deeplake/memory/kpi/<uuid>/` and `cat` each KPI to surface progress.

### 3. Edit a goal description

```bash
# Use Read + Edit (or Write) on the existing file. The VFS handles
# version-bumping — every write produces a fresh row in the
# hivemind_goals table.
```

### 4. Move a goal to in_progress

```bash
mv ~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<owner>/opened/<uuid>.md ~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<owner>/in_progress/<uuid>.md
```

`mv` between status folders is an atomic version-bump. The file body carries over unchanged.

### 5. Close a goal

Two equivalent ways:

```bash
# Explicit mv to closed (recommended — clearest intent)
mv ~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<owner>/in_progress/<uuid>.md ~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<owner>/closed/<uuid>.md

# Or: rm (the VFS interprets rm on a goal path as a soft-close)
rm ~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<owner>/opened/<uuid>.md
```

**Important:** `rm` does NOT actually delete the goal. It is a soft-close — the VFS writes a new version with status=closed. The goal remains in the team-shared table for audit. There is no hard-delete in v1.

### 6. Add a KPI manually

```bash
Write the file at ~/.deeplake/memory/kpi/<uuid>/<kpi-slug>.md with:
  <KPI name>

  - target: <N>
  - current: 0
  - unit: <unit>
```

### 7. Record progress on a KPI

Read the KPI file, increment the `current:` line, write it back:

```
<KPI name>

- target: 5
- current: 3       ← incremented from 2
- unit: count
```

Use the Edit tool for the most surgical change (just the line with `current:`).

### 8. Reassign a goal (transfer ownership)

```bash
mv ~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<old-owner>/<status>/<uuid>.md ~/.deeplake/memory/goal/<new-owner>/<status>/<uuid>.md
```

Goal ownership lives in the path. KPI files do NOT have an owner segment — they are linked to the goal by `<uuid>`, so they need no change when a goal is reassigned.

## Constraints — DO NOT do these

- Do NOT put `owner`, `status`, `goal_id`, or `kpi_id` inside the file body. The path is the source of truth — duplicating in the body causes drift.
- Do NOT use status values other than `opened`, `in_progress`, `closed`.
- Do NOT rename the goal_id (the UUID in the filename) via `mv`. The VFS rejects goal_id renames.
- Do NOT block on the KPI generator subprocess — always spawn it detached (`nohup … &`).
- Do NOT use the old `hivemind tasks` CLI — that belonged to an earlier design and is being removed.

## Auto-progress from `git commit`

A PostToolUse hook listens for `git commit`. When it fires, it spawns the agent's native LLM in the background with the commit diff + the list of the current user's open goals. The LLM reads each goal + its KPIs, judges whether the commit advanced any KPI, and edits the relevant KPI file to bump `current:`. This is fire-and-forget; the user does not block on it.

To disable globally: `HIVEMIND_AUTO_KPI_FROM_COMMITS=false`.

## Team visibility

Every write goes to a team-shared table on Deeplake (`hivemind_goals` or `hivemind_kpis`). Other team members see your goals in their SessionStart context and via direct `ls` / `cat` on the same paths in their own VFS. No explicit sharing step needed.
